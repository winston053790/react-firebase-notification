    You can install Node.js directly from official Node.js website ([link to v16.10.0](https://nodejs.org/dist/v16.10.0/)) or using **nvm** ([nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) for Windows or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for Linux and macOS).

    ```shell
    # Install Node 20.10.0 using nvm.
    nvm install 20.10.0

    # Set 20.10.0 as active version
    nvm use 20.10.0

    # Quick check to see which version is active
    nvm list
    ```

    You should also accept all UAC warnings on Windows.

2. Clone the project from GitHub and navigate to its root. It's the folder with package.json file - the root of GitHub repository. Then, install all dependencies.

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

3. Next, you can start the development server (if you are a developer).

    ```shell
    npm run start
    ```

    The website should be accessible at http://localhost:3000/.

4. ##### For use in production build and serve the project using following commands

    ```shell
    npm run build
